# Spreadsheets are malpractice:
#  - A spreadsheet is just a way to write a simple computer program
#  - But: We want our programs to be testable, reusable, and reliable.
#    - We need to be able to run the same program on different
#      input data.
#    - Spreadsheets embed the data in the program. If you want to
#      work on differnet data, you need to copy your whole program
#      and then modify it to put in different data.
#  - Also, spreadsheets have data-corrupting features like transforming
#    fractions into dates.
