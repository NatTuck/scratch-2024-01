When to optimize a program to go faster?

 - Not now.

 Two exceptions:

  - Operations that have bad computatonal complexity
    are frequently too slow to even try.
    - O(n^2), n = 50, 2500
    - O(2^n), n = 50, A quadrillion
  - You're done with the program, but it's too slow.
    - Profile-guided optimization

Profile-guided optimization

  - Trying to guess why a big program is slow generally doesn't
    work.
  - So instead we want to try it and measure what's 
    actually happening.
  - A profiler will tell you how much time the program spent
    in each method (function) during execution.
  - This gives you the right place to look to start expiermenting
    with optimizations.
