# Graphs

General case allows cycles, multiple paths from root to leaf.

 - Need to deal with the cycles in object references.

Direct Acyclic Graph allows multiple paths but no cycles.

 - This can be allocated easily too.

Tree allows neither cycles nor multiple paths.

 - Trees can be allocated from leaves up.
