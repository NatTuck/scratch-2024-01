# Files and Directories

Files: 

 - A file is a collection of data on your computer
   - The user can do stuff with it, like editing it.
 - A file has two parts:
   - data: A sequence of zero or more bytes.
   - metadata: Stuff like the file name, creation date, etc.

Directories:

 - You can put files in a directory.
 - Directories have names (and other metadata)
 - You can also put directories in directories.
